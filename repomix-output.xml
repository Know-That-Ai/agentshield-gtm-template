# AgentShield Google Tag Manager Template

This repository contains the official Google Tag Manager (GTM) template for AgentShield, an AI agent detection service that protects websites from automated bot traffic.

## Quick Installation

### Method 1: Import from Repository (Recommended)

## Creating a Tag

After importing the template:

1. Go to **Tags** → **New**
2. Click **Tag Configuration**
3. Select **AgentShield Pixel** from Custom templates
4. Configure the required settings:
   - **Project ID**: Your AgentShield project ID (required)
   - **API Endpoint**: Custom endpoint URL (optional)
   - **Debug Mode**: Enable for testing (optional)
   - **Session Timeout**: Session duration in milliseconds (default: 1800000)
   - **Respect Do Not Track**: Honor user DNT preference (default: true)
   - **Batch Size**: Events per batch (default: 10)
   - **Flush Interval**: Batch flush frequency in ms (default: 5000)
   - **Enable Fingerprinting**: Advanced detection (default: true)

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Project ID | Text | Yes | - | Your AgentShield project identifier |
| API Endpoint | Text | No | Auto-detected | Custom API endpoint URL |
| Debug Mode | Checkbox | No | false | Enable console debugging |
